# Filter Editor
Similar to the Edit widget, the Filter Editor widget allows users to edit multiple feature layer services. 
This widget displays each feature layer in a drop down list which provides easier access and readability.  
The ability to filter templates has also been added.  The filtering is done based on the selected feature layer
in the drop down list.  If 'All' is selected, the TemplatePicker will display the filtered templates for all 
of the feature layers.
