Deploying Widget

Setting Up Repository for Development
In order to develop and test widgets you need to deploy the BatchEditor folder to the stemapp/widgets directory in your WebApp Builder installation. If you use Github for windows this can be accomplished using the following steps.

1. Sync the repository to your local machine.
2. Close Open the Repository in Windows Explorer
3. Close Github for Windows
4. Cut and paste the entire BatchEditor folder into the stemapp/widgets folder
5. Launch Github for Windows and choose the option to locate the repository. This will change the location on disk to the new location.
